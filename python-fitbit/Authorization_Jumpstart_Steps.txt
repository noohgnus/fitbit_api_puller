Authorization Jumpstart Steps

1. Run command:
    python gather_keys_oauth2.py

2. In the following browser, copy the "code" part of the url. ***Code is valid for only 10 minutes.
    Example)
        * In https://jhprohealth.app/callback?code=fc749e3de9551ea853dbce84e7c706a6c6c2db7e&state=O01QZcS9XADINyf3ioRrSNbAQ9bi5n#_=_
        * The code part is the string that comes after "code=", which is "fc749e3de9551ea853dbce84e7c706a6c6c2db7e".
        * Notice the '&' character at the end of the code string, that is, right before "state" tag, shouldn't be included in the "code" part.

3. Exit the browser engine script with shortcut:
    CTRL + C

4. Run command:
    python authorizer.py [CODE]
    python apipuller.py [CODE]
        * Here, replace the "[CODE]" part in the command to the actual authorization code you got in step 2.
        * So, the actual command here would be: 
            python authorizer.py fc749e3de9551ea853dbce84e7c706a6c6c2db7e

5. (OPTIONAL) If no cron job is running and you wish to do one-time data-pulling, run command:
    python token_alive.py
        * This is the python code that the cron job will be running.
        * You can check the status of cron jobs running by running command:
            crontab -l
        * To edit cronjob, run command:
            crontab -e
